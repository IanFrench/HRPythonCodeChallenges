Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with places after the decimal.
Note: This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with absolute error of up to  are acceptable.
Example 

There are  elements, two positive, two negative and one zero. Their ratios are ,  and . Results are printed as:
0.400000
0.400000
0.200000
Function Description
Complete the plusMinus function in the editor below.
plusMinus has the following parameter(s):
int arr[n]: an array of integers
Print 
Print the ratios of positive, negative and zero values in the array. Each value should be printed on a separate line with  digits after the decimal. The function should not return a value.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer, , the size of the array. 
The second line contains  space-separated integers that describe .
Constraints
 

Output Format
Print the following  lines, each to  decimals:
proportion of positive values
proportion of negative values
proportion of zeros
Sample Input
STDIN           Function
-----           --------
6               arr[] size n = 6
-4 3 -9 0 4 1   arr = [-4, 3, -9, 0, 4, 1]
Sample Output
0.500000
0.333333
0.166667
Explanation
There are  positive numbers,  negative numbers, and  zero in the array. 
The proportions of occurrence are positive:  , negative:  and zeros:  .

I first tried to use floor to trim my Double to 6 digits but it was ugly code, and it also failed to keep trailing zeros. 
Therefore. I went with option to convert to string and set %.6 instead. Passed all tests.
