Kevin and Stuart want to play the 'The Minion Game'.
Game Rules
Both players are given the same string, .
Both players have to make substrings using the letters of the string .
Stuart has to make words starting with consonants.
Kevin has to make words starting with vowels. 
The game ends when both players have made all possible substrings. 
Scoring
A player gets +1 point for each occurrence of the substring in the string .
For Example:
String  = BANANA
Kevin's vowel beginning word = ANA
Here, ANA occurs twice in BANANA. Hence, Kevin will get 2 Points. 
Your task is to determine the winner of the game and their score.
Function Description
Complete the minion_game in the editor below.
minion_game has the following parameters:
string string: the string to analyze
Prints
string: the winner's name and score, separated by a space on one line, or Draw if there is no winner


My solution:

s = string.upper()
    vowels = 'AEIOU'
    size = len(s)
    k_points = 0
    s_points = 0

    for char in range(size):
        if s[char].isndigit():
        print("Invalid input string."
        return
        if s[char] in vowels:
            #print(s[char])
            k_points += (size - char)
        else:
            #print(s[char])
            s_points += (size - char)
            
    if k_points == s_points:
        print ("Draw")     
    elif s_points > k_points:
        print(f"Stuart {s_points}") 
    else:
        print(f"Kevin {k_points}")
        
    LOGIC:
    Ensured input was all upper case and created a vowels string(edge case of bad input). set size to length of the input string and created variables for players scores. 
    Iterate through the length of the word evaluating first if any of the values are a number we break (edge case again) then if the char value at the index of char is a vowel. If so, then just add the length of the 
    remaining word at that index hence size - char. If not in vowels, same thing for the other player. Continue iterating the whole word and finally 
    compare the scores to determine winner (if there ws one).
