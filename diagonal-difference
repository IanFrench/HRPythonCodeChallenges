Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
For example, the square matrix  is shown below:
1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9  
The left-to-right diagonal = . The right to left diagonal = . Their absolute difference is .
Function description
Complete the  function in the editor below.
diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:
int arr[n][m]: an array of integers
Return
int: the absolute diagonal difference
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer, , the number of rows and columns in the square matrix . 
Each of the next  lines describes a row, , and consists of  space-separated integers .
Constraints

Output Format
Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.

def diagonalDifference(arr):

  if len(arr) != len(arr[0]):
    print("Not a square matrix")
    return

  size = len(arr)-1
  primary = 0
  secondary = 0
  print(*arr, sep="\n")

  for i in range(len(arr)):
    for j in range(len(arr[0])):
      if i + j == size and i == j:
        primary += arr[i][j]
        secondary += arr[i][j]
      if i == j and i + j != size:
        primary += arr[i][j]
      if i + j == size and i != j:
        secondary += arr[i][j]
      else:
        continue
  print(abs(primary - secondary))
